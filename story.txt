Miguel had always felt like something about him was a little different than all the other kids. However, he never really knew exactly what it was. He was 4 years old and had just started going to school. At home his parents loved him very much and always told him that he could become anything he set his mind to. But Miguel never had any interest in becoming anything. One day while Miguel was playing at school during recess. He fell of the swing set and broke his arm in half. However, he didn't feel any pain. The teachers were in panic trying to get him inside the building so that they could take him to the doctor. Eventually they became very confused at the fact that Miguel was not in any pain, even though his arm was completely broken.
